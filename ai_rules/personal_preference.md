# Personal Preference / Output Format (Always Apply)

## Mandatory for Every Stock Response

When you give any stock analysis or quote (whether the user asks with a ticker only like "AAPL" or with a full question), you MUST include the following so the user can make a decision:

1. **Price context**
   - Current price and % change
   - Day high and day low (so they see today’s range)

2. **Important levels**
   - **Support** – level that matters for buying or holding
   - **Resistance** – level that matters for taking profit or shorting
   - Mention any other level that affects the decision (e.g. key EMA, prior close) if relevant

3. **Suggested in/out (entry and exit)**
   - **Entry** – suggested price or zone to enter (e.g. near support, or current if breakout)
   - **Target** – suggested take-profit price or zone (e.g. near resistance or % upside)
   - **Stop** – suggested stop-loss price (e.g. below support or X% risk)

Keep these concise (one line each is fine). Use the format: 入场 / Entry, 目标 / Target, 止损 / Stop (in user’s language). This is the user’s preferred way to see every stock check so they can act on it.
