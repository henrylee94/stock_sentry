# Technical Indicator Interpretation Rules

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

### RSI Ranges and Meanings

**< 30: Oversold** 📉🔵
- **Meaning**: Selling pressure exhausted, potential bounce
- **Action**: Look for reversal signals (hammer candle, volume spike)
- **Warning**: Don't catch falling knife - wait for confirmation
- **Best in**: Range-bound or after pullback in uptrend
- **Avoid in**: Strong downtrend (can stay oversold for long time)

**30-40: Weak Territory** 😐
- **Meaning**: Still weak momentum but stabilizing
- **In uptrend**: Healthy pullback, potential buying opportunity
- **In downtrend**: Still bearish, be cautious
- **Action**: Watch for RSI to cross above 40 for confirmation

**40-60: Neutral Zone** ⚪
- **Meaning**: No strong momentum either direction
- **Action**: Look at other indicators (EMAs, volume, support/resistance)
- **Trading**: Avoid unless clear setup from other signals
- **Best strategy**: Wait for breakout above 60 or below 40

**60-70: Strong but Not Overheated** 📈🟢
- **Meaning**: Good momentum building, room to run
- **In uptrend**: Sweet spot for entries, momentum + not overbought
- **Action**: This is optimal buying zone in trends
- **Best strategy**: Trend following, EMA crossover

**> 70: Overbought** 📈🔴
- **Meaning**: Buying pressure high, potential pullback
- **BUT**: Can stay overbought in strong trends!
- **Check volume**: If declining → Take profit. If strong → Ride it
- **Action**: Don't short just because overbought (can go to 80+)
- **Take profit signal**: RSI > 75 + volume declining

### RSI Divergence (Advanced)

**Bullish Divergence** 🔄📈
- Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low
- **Meaning**: Selling pressure weakening despite lower prices
- **Action**: Reversal likely, look for entry on next bounce
- **Confirmation**: Wait for price to break above recent high
- **Win rate**: ~65% when confirmed

**Bearish Divergence** 🔄📉
- Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high
- **Meaning**: Buying pressure weakening despite higher prices
- **Action**: Reversal likely, consider taking profits
- **Confirmation**: Wait for price to break below recent low
- **Win rate**: ~60% when confirmed

### RSI + Other Indicators

**RSI + EMA:**
- RSI > 50 + Price > EMA9 = Strong buy
- RSI < 50 + Price < EMA9 = Strong sell
- RSI > 50 but Price < EMA9 = Divergence, wait

**RSI + Volume:**
- RSI rising + Volume rising = Confirmed trend
- RSI rising + Volume falling = Weak, likely to fail
- RSI < 30 + Volume spike = Capitulation, often reversal

## EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

### EMA Alignment (Trend Direction)

**Bullish Alignment** 📈
```
Price > EMA9 > EMA21 > EMA50
```
- **Meaning**: Strong uptrend, all timeframes aligned
- **Action**: Buy dips to EMA9 or EMA21
- **Strategy**: Trend following, EMA crossover
- **Stop**: Below EMA21 for aggressive, below EMA50 for conservative

**Bearish Alignment** 📉
```
Price < EMA9 < EMA21 < EMA50
```
- **Meaning**: Strong downtrend, all timeframes aligned
- **Action**: Avoid longs, wait for reversal
- **Strategy**: Short rallies to EMA9 (if shorting)
- **Stop**: Above EMA21 for shorts

**Choppy/Transition** 🌀
```
EMAs tangled or crossing frequently
```
- **Meaning**: No clear trend, market indecisive
- **Action**: Reduce size, use range strategies
- **Strategy**: Support/resistance, mean reversion
- **Stop**: Tight stops, expect whipsaw

### EMA Crossovers

**Golden Cross** (Bullish) ✨
- EMA9 crosses ABOVE EMA21
- **Meaning**: Short-term momentum > longer-term
- **Action**: Early buy signal (confirm with volume)
- **Best when**: Happens above EMA50
- **Win rate**: ~60% if volume confirms

**Death Cross** (Bearish) ☠️
- EMA9 crosses BELOW EMA21
- **Meaning**: Short-term momentum turning down
- **Action**: Early sell signal, reduce longs
- **Best when**: Happens below EMA50
- **Win rate**: ~55-60%

**Major Trend Change:**

- Often marks multi-week trend changes

### Price vs EMA (Entry Points)

**Price Tests EMA9** 🎯
- In uptrend: Buy opportunity (pullback to support)
- In downtrend: Resistance, often rejected
- **Action**: Watch for bounce candle at EMA9
- **Stop**: Just below EMA21

**Price Tests EMA21** 🎯🎯
- Stronger support/resistance than EMA9
- In uptrend: Deeper pullback, higher conviction entry
- **Risk/reward better** but need more patience
- **Stop**: Below EMA50

**Price Tests EMA50** 🎯🎯🎯
- Major support/resistance level
- Breaking this = trend change likely
- **Action**: Wait for confirmation before entry
- **Stop**: 2-3% below EMA50

### EMA Distance (Stretched Conditions)

**Price > 5% above EMA9**
- **Meaning**: Extended, pullback likely
- **Action**: Don't chase, wait for pullback
- **Exception**: Strong momentum with volume

**Price > 10% above EMA21**
- **Meaning**: Very extended, high risk entry
- **Action**: Wait or take profits if already in
- **Expected**: Return to EMA21 within days

## Volume Analysis

### Volume Levels

## Support and Resistance

### Identifying Levels

**Strong Support/Resistance** 💪
- Price tested 3+ times without breaking
- High volume at the level (shows importance)
- Round numbers ($100, $150, $200)
- Previous major highs/lows
- **Action**: High probability bounce/rejection

**Weak Support/Resistance** 🤷

- Low volume tests
- Random price levels
- **Action**: Less reliable, needs confirmation

### Breakout Confirmation

**True Breakout** ✅
- Close above/below level (not just wick)

- **Action**: Enter on retest or breakout candle

**False Breakout** ❌
